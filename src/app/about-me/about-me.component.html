          <h3>I STARTED</h3>
          <p>
            as an industrial mechanic in a energie company. During my work, I quickly noticed that the job in a workshop is nothing for me,
            but still i tried hard to continue my job as an mechanic even if i was not happy with it. But after i had to change my workplace from one Temp Agencie to another. I decided to start a new career.

            started after my Friend came up to me and told me to try it into the Tec. And then again after i informed me about every coding course in Germany , I felt like the Developer Akademie was the right place for me. 
            They teach you the essentials you need to
            become a front end developer, as well as work in a team on your own
            pace and build your own projects.

          <h3>MY PASSION</h3>
          <p>
            was always computers, since I was spending a lot of my spare time
            with work on my PC. I was curious about how software is being
            developed and always wanted to be a software developer, but was
            insecure because of the misbelief that you need to be a genius or start a studies to be
            able to become a programmer.

          <h3>MY JOURNEY</h3>
          <p>
            in the first month of learning, I discovered new sides of myself,
            since I always struggled to learn more than 30min a day in school. But
            when I started learning interesting things I was shocked that I was
            able to learn 8+ hours a day without getting bored or tired. That was
            the moment I realized I'm doing the right thing.
